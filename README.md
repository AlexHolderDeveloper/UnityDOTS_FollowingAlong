Using Unity 2019.4.1f1 with these DOTS-related packages:

* Entities 0.11.0
* Hybrid Renderer 0.5.1


Part 1-4's result is in "Scenes/ECS_Intro".


Part 5's result is in "Scenes/Jobs_Intro".


Part 6's result is in "Scenes/JobifiedVoxelWave".
Each part in the tutorial builds up to the voxel wave - you can see the GIF above for a visual example of what to expect!

Download it & see what your framerate is in the JobifiedVoxelWave scene. There's 2500 cubes moving there!
